##LG_Prime Biography â€“ Patrick Genovese
I created a bot that will help Lisa Gilligan not only increase the amount of potential clients, 
but also help those potential clients to be informed. The bot will walk clients through a complex form
that normally Lisa GIlligan would do herself and educate them along the way. This way, the potential 
clients will be able to move through Lisa Gilligan's intake process faster, and save her from filling out, what she 
calls "that damn form." LG_Prime can be found at: *******insert link

##Framing
Lisa Gilligan runs her own solo practice out of Reading Massachusetts. She has a husband, two children, and two brand new
grandchildren. Between work and her growing family, Lisa needs to utilize every minute she has. When we first spoke about potential
projects, I asked her, "What is something you do all the time, that you wish you never had to do again?" she told me "This damn form!" 
She showed me a seven page packet that she has to go through with each of her clients seeking estate planning advice. This process on 
average took roughly thirty minutes or more, due to all of the complex legalese within the form, that the clients didnt understand. 
I created a recource  that would walk clients through this form, educate them on legal issues and then if they wanted, direct them
to Lisa Gilligan's office. This would give her more clients who were educated and ready to begin, and more time to focus on more cases. 

##Research
First I had Lisa Gilligan go through the form with me the way that she would with a client. This way I was able to see how she would 
explain certain concepts, which parts of the form she would emphasize, and how long it would take. Next I looked to see if there
was already a bot out there that could go through this form. The closest thing I found to a solution was clicking through mass.gov
and consulting an attorney or clerk. Next, I looked up all of the mpc forms that this form referenced and gained an understanding of what 
they each required. Finally I looked up the legal language definitions and put them into lay people terms.

##Ideation & Prototyping
Considering all of the potential toos for this solution, I narrowed my selection down to Community Lawyer and QnA Markup. Community 
Lawyer has better accessibility, but I was more familiar with QnA and how to insert javascript and export information. Plus, I felt less
restricted using the QnA tools. I chose QnA because I believed more in my ability with this tool to create a better product.

##User Testing
After I had finished creating what I thought would be extremely helpful code, I put the product in the hands of a tester named Vasiliki.
She is a Reasearch Coordinator at Mass General Hospital and works with pateints who have downs sydrome. She has no legal experience and
had no idea what my vision was for the bot. After 5 minutes i had a handful of notes to improve the bot. Most of the notes included 
adding more descriptions and definitions. After implementing those changes, I had my roommate Liam test the bot. He is an Associate 
Producer and works mostly in television or commercials. He has a father who is an Eldr Law Attorney, but has no legal experience himself. 
Again, he did not know my vision for the bot. Liam sugested that it would be helpful to get an option to consult an attorney at multiple 
stages of LG_Prime. He also suggested that it would be easier for the user to click on the items in the checklist and have the document 
popup rather than have it lead you to a follow up question asking if they wanted the link. 


Refinement
Each time the bot was tested I had the users fill out a standard form I created. It can be found at: *****insert link****. I would 
review the form soon after it was done and clarify certain questions they had or suggestions they offered. Then I would implement 
the changes they suggested thatalso would help reach the goal. I started with a simple bot. Then I added javascript and additional 
resources. Finally I created a function that would allow the user to get documentation of the important information LG_Prime gathered.
After three rounds of user testing and ******* mark up file variations, LG_Prime is ready for the client, Lisa Gilligan.
