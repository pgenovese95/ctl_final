Brainstorm potential partners:
  1. Mr. Crowely
  2. Mrs. Gilligan
  3. Liberty Mutual
  4. Judge Patten
  5. Comunity Lawyer
Choose:
  Mrs. Gilligan
Why:
  Mr. Gilligan has the least support within her practice among the potential partners. she is in an interesting field I know little about. She is easily accessible given our informal and friendy rapport.

Meetings will Partner: 
I initial meeting via text
    I explained the project, what i have orked on in the past, asked her to take some time and think about the work she is doing this week and we can talk again over the weekend 
   
Second meeting
      Mrs. Gilligan spoke about her solo practice having to be in court, communicate with clients, juggle her new baby grandkids and her mundane office work
                I Hone in on the mundane work
      The most boring piece of work that takes the most time is the questionaire to determine whether the client can use a formal or informal petition to request an appointed representative
      It can be flowcharted easily. the terms used are too complex for a layperson. Mrs. Gilligan hates it 
                  We found a winner.
