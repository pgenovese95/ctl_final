User: Vasiliki Patsiogiannis- Clinical Research Coordinator at MGH
Experience:
1.	Do you have any legal experience?
a.	No_________________
2.	Do you have any experience estate planning?
a.	No_________________
During Testing:
1.	List any questions you found difficult to answer: 
a.	The question referring to the appointment by statute – I’m not quite sure what this means. 
b.	The question asking if the person is incapacitated
c.	The question in reference to a conservator
d.	Is the personal representative to be appointed a public administrator?
e.	Is there a since deceased hair or devisee?
2.	Why were they difficult?
a.	What does appointment by statute mean? Perhaps there could be a note describing this
b.	I would also be interested in having a clear definition of what being “incapacitated” means as this could mean a lot e.g. is an older person “incapacitated”?
c.	I’m not sure who a conservator is in this context and what their position would be
d.	I struggled a little bit with the chain of who the devisee is, who the personal representative is and then who the public administrator would be – of course these are technical, important terms. Definitions or notes for the public would be very helpful.
e.	I would like a clearer distinction and definition of devisee. Perhaps this question can be phrased differently.
