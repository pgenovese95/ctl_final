##LG_Prime Biography â€“ Patrick Genovese
I created a bot that will help Lisa Gilligan not only increase the amount of potential clients, 
but also help those potential clients to be informed. The bot will walk clients through a complex form
that normally Lisa GIlligan would do herself and educate them along the way. This way, the potential 
clients will be able to move through Lisa Gilligan's intake process faster, and save her from filling out, what she 
calls "that damn form."  Since QnA has a data limit on what it can create a link for, LG_Prime html 
can be found at:https://pgenovese95.github.io/ctl_final/LG_Prime.html and LG_Prime text can 
be found at: https://pgenovese95.github.io/ctl_final/LG_Prime.txt

##Framing
Lisa Gilligan runs her own solo practice out of Reading Massachusetts. She has a husband, two children, and two brand new
grandchildren. Between work and her growing family, Lisa needs to utilize every minute she has. When we first spoke about potential
projects, I asked her, "What is something you do all the time, that you wish you never had to do again?" she told me "This damn form!" 
She showed me a seven page packet that she has to go through with each of her clients seeking estate planning advice. This process on 
average took roughly 30-35 minutes, due to all of the complex legalese within the form, that the clients didnt understand. 
I created a recource  that would walk clients through this form, educate them on legal issues and then if they wanted, direct them
to Lisa Gilligan's office. This would give her more clients who were educated and ready to begin, and more time to focus on more cases. 

##Research
First I had Lisa Gilligan go through the form with me the way that she would with a client. This way I was able to see how she would 
explain certain concepts, which parts of the form she would emphasize, and how long it would take. Next I looked to see if there
was already a bot out there that could go through this form. The closest thing I found to a solution was clicking through mass.gov
and consulting an attorney or clerk. Next, I looked up all of the mpc forms that this form referenced and gained an understanding of what 
they each required. Finally I looked up the legal language definitions and put them into lay people terms.

##Ideation & Prototyping
Considering all of the potential tools for this solution, I narrowed my selection down to Community Lawyer and QnA Markup. Community 
Lawyer has better accessibility, but I was more familiar with QnA and how to insert javascript functions. Plus, I felt less
restricted using the QnA tools. I chose QnA because I believed more in my ability to create a better product with this tool. After 
identifying the proper negative and possitive flows for the questions I would use, I created my very simple QnA prototype, which was a 
good jumping off point for any refinements identified after user testing.

##User Testing
After I had finished creating what I thought would be extremely helpful code, I put the product in the hands of a tester named Vasiliki.
She is a Reasearch Coordinator at Mass General Hospital and works with pateints who have downs sydrome. She has no legal experience and
had no idea what my vision was for the bot. After 5 minutes i had a handful of notes to improve the bot. Most of the notes included 
adding more descriptions and definitions. After implementing those changes, I had my roommate Liam test the bot. He is an Associate 
Producer and works mostly in television or commercials. He has a father who is an Eldr Law Attorney, but has no legal experience himself. 
Again, he did not know my vision for the bot. Liam sugested that it would be easier for the user to click on the items in the checklist 
and have the document popup rather than have it lead you to a follow up question asking if they wanted the link. The third user tester 
was none other than Lisa Gilligan's son, Larry. Larry is a Liquor Merchandiser. Like the previous testers, he has no legal expierence. 
Unlike the previous two, Larry did have a rough understanding of what my goal was for the bot. Larry was able to give a valusable 
suggestion; the user should have an option to consult an attorney at multiple stages of LG_Prime.

Mrs. Gilligan's feedback can be found at :https://github.com/pgenovese95/ctl_final/blob/master/client_feedback


###Refinement
Each time the bot was tested I had the users fill out a standard form I created that can be found in the ctl final repo 
under "Feedback Form" I would review the form soon after it was done and clarify certain questions they had or suggestions they offered. 
Then I would implement the changes they suggested thatalso would help reach the goal. I started with a simple bot. Then I 
added javascript and additional resources. Finally I created a function that would allow the user to get documentation of the 
important information LG_Prime gathered. After three rounds of user testing and over 70 mark up file variations, LG_Prime is one fixed
bug away from being perfect for Lisa Gilligan.


##Intro Pitch
The PowerPoint used for my intro pitch can be found at:https://pgenovese95.github.io/ctl_final/Solo Practitioner, You are not alone.pptx
For my pitch I focused on telling the story of the client. This kept everyone's fous on the "why" rather than the "what" 
which is the most important.


##Complexity/Robustness
This an extremely robust QnA, which has multiple choice, fill in the balnks, reference call backs, embedded links, 
javascript features including document creation and more.

##Impact & Efficiencies
Because this product was only recently released, it is impossible to tell right now how effective it will truly be. However by
comparing the old process to using LG_Prime, Lisa Gilligan will now save approximately 25 minutes with each client that uses LG_Prime
and she will never have to fill out "that damn form" again if she doesnt want to. Save her time means she can either take on more clients,
focus on more complex issues, or simply spend more time with her family and get a chance to breathe! A laywer's happiness is important 
too. 


##Fit/Completeness
This bot set out to enable Lisa Gilligan to have more time in her day. For that to happen the bot would have to be prototyped, tested,
and refined over 70 times in order to be a relaible tool. As it stands now, it cuts down on client intake by roughtly 25 
minutes per client. The bot has been scrubbed of confusing legalese and clear definitions have been implemented into the smooth flow
of use. This bot has accomplished the goals of my client.


##Documentation
I have addressed all of the user concerns from the user testing. I have cut down on all unecessary legalese. The bot flows beautifully. 
Client users will be able to understand what they are being asked and also become comfortable with this portion of the estate planning
process. My partner would easily be able to dive in and change language once getting additional feedback if necessary and also recieve 
LG_Prime-gathered information in a digestable way to help her implement the information seemlessly into her representation.

##Real World Viability
This QnA is very close to being ready. The QnA itself works and will give clients valuable resources and save Mrs. Gilligan time and get 
more clients, but the document that is created at the end for the user has a minor bug that inputs an answer twice near the bottom. As of
now, this bug has not been resolved. It is the only thing holding this back from being client ready.

##Sustainability
This bot will be only as good as its latest update. Unfortunately, Probate laws, procedures, and forms are subject to change. Luckily,
the QnA is flexible and implementing new forms or new rules will be simple so long as the person implementing the change is familiar
with QnA.
